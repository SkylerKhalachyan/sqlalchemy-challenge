# SQLALCHEMY-Challenge
#
### Overview of Project
# 
For this project, we imagined we were going on a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with our trip planning, we decided to do a climate analysis of the area. We did a precipitation analysis that looked at the precipitation metrics over the previous year. We also did an analysis of the stations. We looked at the same 12-month period of temperature observations for those stations.
