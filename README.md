### Overview of Project
# 
For this project, our cohort imagined we were going on a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. This is a climate analysis of the area to help with our trip planning. A precipitation analysis looks at the precipitation metrics over the previous year. An analysis of the stations looks at the same 12-month period of temperature observations for those weather stations.
